/// Seems like we have to compare each of the words to the word on the earlier line
/// we then store this word for that var, if we come to the same var
/// and we check above word and it is wrong the thing doesn't work
/// Need to check both way because the var can be different for both ways
/// 
/// Transpose each var with words and check against other if we can match them
/// 
/// 
/// we can map each word to specific location in array so 1 goes to one, makes it easier to comapare what is there
